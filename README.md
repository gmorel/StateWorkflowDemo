Helping you implementing a complex yet easily maintainable workflow.
---------------------------------------------

Keywords : State Design Pattern, Workflow, Finite State Machine, Symfony2


A demonstration project for [StateWorkflowBundle](https://github.com/gmorel/StateWorkflowBundle).

Here is the generated Workflow Specification generated using the command CLI `sf gmorel:state-engine:generate-workflow-specifications` : [demo.booking_engine.state_workflow.html](http://rawgit.com/gmorel/StateWorkflowDemo/master/specification/workflow/demo.booking_engine.state_workflow.html). 

Cytoscape generates the workflow layout randomly. If the layout doesn't suit well, refresh.
